# autolisp-floor-heating

Spiral floor heating for arbitrary polygon.


The program is able to draw multiline from user inputed points, and can calculate intersections.

The plan is to create an inward polyline spiral which will be later edited to be floor heating spirral.

For the first draft, only counter clockwise inputs will work.
